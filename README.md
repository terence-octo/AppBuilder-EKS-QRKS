# App Builder
This repo was populated by the [Octopus App Builder](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/content-team-apps) tool. The directory structure is shown below:

* `.github/workflows`: GitHub Action Workflows that populate a cloud Octopus instance, build and deploy the sample code, and initiate a deployment in Octopus.
* `github`: Composable GitHub Actions that are called by the workflow files.
* `terraform`: Terraform templates used to create cloud resources and populate the Octopus cloud instance.
* `java`: The sample Java application.
* `js`: The sample JavaScript application.
* `dotnet`: The sample DotNET application.

If you have run the App Builder for a second time, the files are placed in the `app-builder-update` branch.
The workflow files are configured to not run from this branch, meaning any changes you have made in the main branch will not be overwritten.
To replace the `main` branch with the `app-builder-update` branch, [run the following commands](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2862938/157605):
1. `git checkout app-builder-update`
2. `git merge -s ours main`
3. `git checkout main`
4. `git merge app-builder-update`

If you would rather see what has changed since you last ran the App Builder, create a regular pull request between the `app-builder-update` and `main` branches.
